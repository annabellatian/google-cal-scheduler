# googleCalScheduler

This is a tool for LCS students to add classes to their Google Calendar as events. Due to the pandemic, class schedules changed, making it difficult to remember which two classes are occuring each day. Since Google Calendar is more accessible than the class schedule on the website (Veracross), this tool will allow students to find their classes with more ease and convenience.
